# SSPy - A python-based level editor for SS+ (or Sound Space)

## FAQ:
> What's planned?

Opening .sspm maps and raw text maps, and saving as .sspm files.\
Quantum notes will obviously be supported, but beziers are a no-go.

> Why is there no Vulnus support?

Don't even fucking get me started about Vulnus. There's many reasons I want kermeet's head on a metaphorical spike, and I don't wanna get into it.
