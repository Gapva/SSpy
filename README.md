# SSPy - A python-based level editor for SS+ (or Sound Space)



---
## FAQ:
> What's planned?

Opening .sspm maps and raw text maps, and saving as .sspm files.\
Quantum notes will obviously be supported, but beziers might be annoying.

> Why is there no Vulnus support?

Don't get me started.

> How do I run it?
Install git and python if you haven't, then
`git clone [url] sspy
cd sspy
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py`
